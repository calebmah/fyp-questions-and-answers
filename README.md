# FYP on generating questions and answers using CNNs

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network algorithm to generate questions and answers. In particular, the algorithm will be evaluated using the benchmark [bAbi dataset](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/).

This is a Final Year Project by [Caleb Mah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-mah/), under supervision by Associate Professor Xavier Bresson.
