### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network algorithm to generate questions and answers. In particular, the algorithm will be evaluated using the benchmark [bAbi dataset](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/).

Two main methods for generating questions and answers will be compared:
1. [Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05493.pdf) by Yujia Li, Daniel Tarlow, Marc Brockschmidt, Richard Zemel
2. [Residual Gated Graph ConvNets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07553.pdf) by Xavier Bresson, Thomas Laurent

The first method has been applied to question and answer generation, whereas the second approach using Residual Gated Graph ConvNets proposes a new approach for tasks involving graph learning. The primary challenge for this project will be to apply this approach to the generation of questions and answers.
